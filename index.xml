      <description>Hi! I am Nick, a masters student at the University of Pennsylvania studying robotics. I come from a mechanical engineering background, and my focus in the robotics field is currently path/motion planning and controls. I have a natural curiosity for all subfields in robotics, so I have exposure to machine learning, perception, mechatronics, and mechanical design. The goal of this F1TENTH journey is simple: win at ICRA 2022 in Philadelphia at the F1TENTH race.</description>

      <description>A Quick Note Hello! And welcome to my first post about my journey in F1TENTH. To begin this journey, I learned as much ROS as I could in order to solidy a solid framework for dealing with multiple sensors and data pipelines. Since ROS1 and ROS2 use the same core concepts, I decided to use ROS noetic as my distribution since I am new to ROS. ROS2 has more features and tools, which will only complicate learning the basics.</description>
